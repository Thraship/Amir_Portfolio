# [Project 1: Stroke Prediction](https://github.com/Thraship/stroke_prediction)

## Motivation
The endgoal for this project is to answer the following questions:

1. Could a relatively accurate model be developed for predicting stroke probability?
2. What are the most important factors in predicting the above probability?

## Project Overview
- The objective is to predict the likelihood of patients getting strokes based on input features such as age, gender, bmi, ...
- Dataset was attained from https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset
- Cleaned data from over 5000 patients
- Created and optimized a Random Forest Classification model by using GridSearchCV to reach 94.4% accuracy to predict stroke probability
- Model was saved using joblib library
